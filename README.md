# emotions_in_tweets

Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sa-emotions/data

The goal is to classify tweets in 13 different emotions: anger, boredom, empty, enthusiasm, fun, happiness, hate, love, neutral, relief, sadness, surprise and worry.

In the "master" branch, the approach is to use a random forest as a classifier and in the "neural network" branch the model is built with a LSTM neural network.
